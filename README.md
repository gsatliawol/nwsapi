# NWS API demo 

### This is a little demo showing the NWS API in both Bash and Python

The US National Weather Service allows access to its data via JSON API.  
The API is [here](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api). 

Herein we look up the temperature, and the time that temperature was 
recorded, using both curl and the Python urllib and json libraries.
